==========================

An `AWS Professional Service <https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services>`_ `open source <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler>`_ python initiative that extends the power of `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ library to AWS connecting **DataFrames** and AWS data related services.
