What is AWS Data Wrangler?
==========================

An `AWS Professional Service <https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services>`_ `open source <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler>`_ python initiative that extends the power of `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ library to AWS connecting **DataFrames** and AWS data related services (**Amazon Redshift**, **AWS Glue**, **Amazon Athena**, **Amazon Timestream**, **Amazon EMR**, **Amazon QuickSight**, etc).

Built on top of other open-source projects like `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_, `Apache Arrow <https://github.com/apache/arrow>`_ and `Boto3 <https://github.com/boto/boto3>`_, it offers abstracted functions to execute usual ETL tasks like load/unload data from **Data Lakes**, **Data Warehouses** and **Databases**.
