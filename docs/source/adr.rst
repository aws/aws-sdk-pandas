Architectural Decision Records
==============================

A collection of records for "architecturally significant" decisions:
those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

These decisions are made by the team which maintains *AWS SDK for pandas*.
However, suggestions can be submitted by any contributor via issues or pull requests.

.. note:: You can also find all ADRs on `GitHub <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-pandas/tree/main/docs/adr>`_.
